Problem:
You have a long binary sequence and need to predict if and when repetitions (like "111", "000") will occur based on previous patterns in the sequence.

Solution:
Use an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model to process the sequence.
The LSTM captures long-term dependencies and learns patterns in the sequence.
Input: A sequence of binary digits.
Output: Predict if repetition will occur, and if so, what the repetition will be (e.g., "111", "000", "11111").

Model Approach:
Preprocess the sequence (e.g., convert to one-hot encoding).
Train the LSTM to recognize patterns and predict repetition likelihood.

The model outputs:
No repetition if none is predicted.
Repetition with the specific pattern if one is likely.

Goal:
The model learns from the sequenceâ€™s context to predict where and what type of repetition will happen next.
